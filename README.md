# Machine Learning: Doodle Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

Step by step tutorial series on making a game like **Quick, Draw!**. It is an online game that challenges players to draw a doodle and then artificial intelligence guesses what the drawings represent.

To show the process of developing this game, here is the source code for the **Doodle Predictor** game made in HTML5 using [Phaser 2 framework](http://phaser.io/) and [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning. To recognize doodles, the game uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on the small subset of the [Quick Draw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

To get a quick insight into the project, watch the video trailer:

This project is divided into 8 parts. Each part includes a video and fully-commented source code so you can follow game development step by step.


## Part 1: Introduction 

In this part, we just create a new Phaser Game object and then build the basic game structure using two source files:  
`main.js` - the main program with the main loop where the entire game logic will be implemented  
`ui.js` - the user interface class to allow users an interaction with the game
